const usage = `ðŸ“‘ coverdiff - print Go test coverage as diff

Usage:
	coverdiff [file]
	coverdiff test

Flags:
	-h, --help	print help text

coverdiff is a tool that processes Go cover profiles and displays coverage
differences directly on the terminal, similar to Go's -html option. You can
provide the cover profile as a file, pass it through standard input, or let
coverdiff run the Go tests.

Examples:

	coverdiff test

	go test -cover -coverprofile=coverage.out
	cat coverage.out | coverdiff

	go test -cover -coverprofile >(coverdiff)

`

func printUsage(stderr io.Writer) func() {
	// return func() to conform with the required type of flag.CommandLine.Usage
	return func() {
		fmt.Fprint(stderr, usage)
	}
}
